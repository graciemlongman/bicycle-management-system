class BikeSelect():
    '''
    Class containing functions that allow the store manage to choose bikes 
    to maintain or expand inventory. Based on popularity, age and condition.
    Has trend visualisation functionality

    Notes: every bike in the inventory table has a unique bicycle id AND a 
    non-unique model id, which is the foreign key to the models table, and which
    describes the non-variable attributes of the bike model such as brand/type/
    size.

    FUNCTIONS:
    - select(self, database, allocation, budget) -> df
        To expand the current inventory:
            Every bike in the inventory is assigned an overall score based on 
            age, popularity and condition. The closer to 100, the more likely it
            will be to get replaced.
            The top ten bikes are then chosen, and the algorithm selects bikes 
            from this list within the budget.

        To choose new bikes:
            The bikes are chosen from the model dataframe if they are not in the 
            current inventory.
        
        Budget allocation can be adjusted based on user's priority for replacing
        bikes or buying new ones.
